AstroBlaster is my take on a classic arcade shooter, Asteroids. It was made by following the tutorial from Gamemaker, but then modified to add some new features.

See the release page for the latest version, and `Notes/Changelog/Changelog.txt` for a complete history of changes.

This project is primarily for education and will not be frequently updated.
